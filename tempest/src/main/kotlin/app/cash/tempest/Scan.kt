/**
 * By default, the Scan operation processes data sequentially. Amazon DynamoDB returns data to the
 * application in 1 MB increments, and an application performs additional Scan operations to
 * retrieve the next 1 MB of data.
 *
 * The larger the table or index being scanned, the more time the Scan takes to complete. In
 * addition, a sequential Scan might not always be able to fully use the provisioned read throughput
 * capacity: Even though DynamoDB distributes a large table's data across multiple physical
 * partitions, a Scan operation can only read one partition at a time. For this reason, the
 * throughput of a Scan is constrained by the maximum throughput of a single partition.
 *
 * To address these issues, the Scan operation can logically divide a table or secondary index into
 * multiple segments, with multiple application workers scanning the segments in parallel. Each
 * worker can be a thread (in programming languages that support multithreading) or an operating
 * system process. To perform a parallel scan, each worker issues its own Scan request with an
 * unique [WorkerId].
